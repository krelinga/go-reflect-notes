// Go's reflection system is powerful, but can be confusing to new users.  This package
// provides a set of notes and examples to help understand how reflection works in Go.
//
// The package is structured into a few top-level functions that are like section headers.
// Each function has some comments explaining the concepts, and links to some example to
// demonstrate the concepts in action.
